Display an error message when a user attempts to add a submission after 8 submissions.

Part 3

Create a page to display submissions in competing pairs.
Allow the user to vote as many times as they want. After a vote, make sure to send a POST request to the server to increment the vote for that specific submission.

Part 4

Add a button to the bottom of the submission page to determine a winner for the current round. There should be three rounds (8 submissions, 4 submissions, 2 submissions).
When a round is complete, the submissions page should update, again, displaying submissions in competing pairs.
When a winner is crowned, add a new button to allow the contest to start over! Once pressed, redirect the user to the submissions page to add new submissions.
